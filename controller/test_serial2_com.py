üîå Serial Communication Test Script for Jetson AGX Xavier - UART
üß† What This Script Does (Python Side)
        This Python script establishes UART-based serial communication using the pyserial library on the Jetson AGX Xavier via /dev/ttyTHS0. Here's a breakdown:

        Opens a serial port (/dev/ttyTHS0) at a baud rate of 9600.

        Continuously:

                Prompts the user for an integer input (0-255).

                Converts the integer to a byte and sends it over UART.

                Reads any response coming back on the same serial line and prints it to the terminal.

üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Setup (Jetson AGX Xavier UART)
        To ensure proper UART communication on the Jetson AGX Xavier:
        to check what you sent and what is recieve:

        UART_TX (Transmit) Pin 8  (Connected directly to ) ‚Üí UART_RX (Receive) Pin 10
